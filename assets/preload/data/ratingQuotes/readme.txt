Your rating quotes should go here!

To add a quote for the game, make a new line in the following format:

Insert Quote Name Here, 0.1

where "Insert Quote Name Here" is the name of your quote and 0.1 is the maximum accuracy (The game will multiply that by 100 when displaying your accuracy, so don't worry) that you can go before it will show the next rating quote. You must put at least 1 quote which goes up to 100% accuracy or the game will crash!
If there's more than 1 comma in your quote, don't worry as the game will automatically handle that!

To add it as an option for the game, put the name of the quote list's text file inside list.txt! The game will automatically read it.
